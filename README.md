# project-mcu-2
Repo to hold files for our second Project MCU project by Eric, Marcus, Nick, and Ana.

We’re looking to get Spotify Data points (danceability, energy, beats per minute, etc.) for as many of the Top 50 songs streamed on Spotify as possible. We’re using a large dataset dating back from 1920 (filtered to 2010 and above) that includes additional audio features not found in our Top 50 dataset. Our goal is to merge the data to uncover just what made these top 50 songs so popular to the contemporary public.
